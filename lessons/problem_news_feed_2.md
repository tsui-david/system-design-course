@question
How many posts can we expect to be made daily?

@answer
In order to answer this we simply need to know the number of daily active users (DAU). Let us assume we have 10 million DAU and each DAU makes a single post, we will have 10 million posts a day.

@question
How many notifications will be sent out daily?

@answer
If we have 10 million DAU (Daily Active Users) and each user can have 5000 friends, let us assume each user posts once a day and each user has half the number of friends.
10 million * 2500 friends = 2,500,000,000 notifications across all users.

@question
What type of content can a post be made up of?

@answer
A post can contain text, images, and video.
