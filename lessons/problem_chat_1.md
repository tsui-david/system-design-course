@question
What are the requirements and goals of the system?

@hint
Consider asking the following questions:
1. What features are wanted? (Try not to assume what ones are expected)
2. Do we want one to one or group chat? 
3. What can be built from scratch vs what can be leveraged 3rd partywise?

@answer
For this problem we want to consider a minimum of:
1. The chat app will support 1 on 1 and group chat.
2. The chat app will support both mobile and web app.
3. The chat app will only support an online indicator and text messages. 
4. The chat app will store the history. 

Limitations to consider:
1. Support for several million daily users a day.
2. Group chat up to a hundred people.
