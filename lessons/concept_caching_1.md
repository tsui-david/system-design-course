@question What happens when repeated requests are made to a far away web server?

@question What is the Locality of Reference Principle? With this in mind, define caching.

@answer Caching takes advantage of the Locality of Reference Principle which states that recently requested data is likely to be requested again. Therefore, caching is the act of storing reusable data responses in order to make subsequent requests faster. When a request is made, caches are checked for the requested data along the way to the origin location of the data.


@question What are different types of caches?

@answer Although caching is widely used in all levels of computing, we will focus primarily on web content caching. Three of the main types of caches are:
- Application:
- Distributed:
- Global:








@question What benefits does it provide?
Caching allows time and resource intensive requests to be completed much more quickly.

When the data being requested is read frequently and updated infrequently.


However caches are much smaller than the disk space or server side storage they are storing data from so they must only store data that falls in 


They are found at all levels of computer architecture.
A cache is a section of memory that can be accessed more quickly (due to either physical proximity, connection speed, or both) by the computer or component requesting the data. 
but is much smaller than disk space or server side storage.
