@question When would you use a CDN?

@hint Remember the cost of CDNs and how they work (geographically).

@answer CDNs should really only be used by websites with high traffic and websites that have global reach. This is because CDNs can protect the host server from large surges in traffic which are instead handled by the CDN and because users from other parts of the globe will have a similar experience to users that are closer to the host server with CDNs. Websites that don't experience either of these issues would not reap the benefits provided by CDNs.


@question How would Netflix use a CDN?

@answer If Netflix were about to release a highly anticipated movie, ensuring that their servers are not bogged down with requests that could degrade the user experience would be a priority. Therefore, Netflix could pre-load the movie to CDNs in order to distribute the load of serving all the requests once the movie is made available. Furthermore, users in other countries would also benefit by having the film buffer at a similar speed to other users rather than more slowly due to being distant from Netflix's primary host servers.
