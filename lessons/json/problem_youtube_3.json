What are some of the features YouTube should have?"]}, {"question": "How do we handle uploading videos?", "answer": "Uploading and streaming videos could be done through REST APIs. For general information on rest checkout @link:[](api1). Let's look at how we might upload a video. The endpoint could be a POST `https://youtube.com/<user_id>/videos`. We can have an initial POST to create initial metadata placeholder such as the date, user, title, details, likes/dislikes, tags, category_id etc. The header for the POST could contain the api key. Then, have a PATCH to the api endpoint with the actual video base64 encoded.", "hints": []}, {"question": "How do we upload the video file itself?", "answer": "The client uploader can upload videos in chunks to help with threading as well as bandwidth and video indexing. This is known as _multi part_ upload. S3 actually [has such feature built in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingRESTAPImpUpload.html). It works by having the client initiate a request and the api responds with an upload id. The client then begins to chunk the content and send the chunk data, the hash of the data so that the server can validate the integrity of the chunk, and the chunk sequence number.", "hints": ["One strategy is to directly upload the entire file to some sort of storage like Amazon S3. However some videos can be long and as a result the uploaded file can be pretty large.

These would essentially be done through another type of video protocol.", "hints": []}, {"question": "How does the actual video content get streamed?", "answer": "The files will be chunked on the s3 storage. When we initiate the GET request for the video, we can download the chunk one by one.", "hints": ["Thank back to how the video was uploaded.
