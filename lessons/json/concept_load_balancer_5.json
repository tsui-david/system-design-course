{"concept_load_balancer_5": {"questions": [{"question": "How does a load balancer choose which server to route to?", "answer": "Selecting a server depends on two things: the status of the server and the load balancing algorithm being used. The load balancer must consider: - The state of the servers (health checks) - The type of requests being made - The duration of the tasks and change route connections accordingly. For health checks, a load balancer will monitor connections to servers, if a server does not respond, it is removed from the pool of available servers. The type of request and duration of tasks are mostly factors taken into consideration by the load balancers routing algorithm.", "hints": ["Think about the single point of failure and overloaded servers problems."]}]}, "lesson_id": "load_balancer_5", "lesson_title": "Load Balancing Algorithms", "video_url": "???", "question": "Name some load balancing algorithms.
