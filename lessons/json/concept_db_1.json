One should be able to identify various entities of the system, how they interact with each other, and different aspect of data management like storage, transportation, encryption. Think relational and non-relational.", "hints": ["database: an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system."]}, {"answer": "If you're working with a schema that allows data to be organized into tables with columns and rows. RDBMS are very traditional and have been around the longest, thus they have the biggest support and resources, people likely more familiar. Data integrity is a particular concern in relational databases, RDMS use a number of constraints to ensure that the data contained in your tables is reliable and accurate. All RDBMS are ACID-compliant.     Atomicity     Consistency     Isolation     Durability", "question": "When would one use a relational database?", "hints": ["relational database: are also called relational database management system (RDBMS) or SQL database *some popular RDBMS are MySQL, Oracle DB, PostgresSQL"]}, {"answer": "Key-value stores: (Redis, Amazon DynamoDB) simple DBMS that store only key-value pairs and provide basic functionality for retrieving the value associated with a known key Wide column stores: (Cassandra, Scylla, HBase) schema-agnostic systems that enable users to store data in column families or tables, a single row of which can be thought as a record -- a multi-dimensional key-value store Document stores: (MongoDB, Couchbase) schema-free systems that store data in the form of JSON documents. Document stores are similar to key-value or wide column stores, but the document name is the key and the contents of the document, whatever they are, are the value. Graph Database: (Neo4j, Datastax Enterprise Graph) represent data as a network of related nodes or objects in order to facilitate data visualizations and graph analytics Search Engines: (Elasticsearch, Spluk, Solr) store data using schema-free JSON documents.
