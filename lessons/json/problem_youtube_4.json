{"problem_youtube_4": {"questions": [{"question": "What architectural components should we consider?", "answer": "The general architecture of YouTube would need: 1. Some sort of distributed file storage for videos. As mentioned previously, s3 is a good candidate. 2. Thumbnail images can be stored in s3 as well. But thumbnails are inherently small files where the number of thumbnails outnumber the number of videos. As a result, storing thumbnails in a key/value db like DynamoDB might be a good choice. 3. A database is needed to store the video metadata/users/video mapping/image mapping. 4. A web server to handle the requests sent to fetch videos/metadata. 5. A proxy/load balancer to handle REST traffic from clients. 6. In order to handle different qualities in videos, the webserver should _encode_ the videos into different format (720p, 1080p, HD, etc), thus a seperate encoding service", "hints": ["Again, think back to what features we wish to solve in YouTube. The system should be able to handle upload, smooth viewing, and have the users able to like, dislike.", "How should we store the YouTube videos?", "How should we store the metadata associated with YouTube videos?", "How should we store the thumbnails of each video?", "When we watch YouTube at lower bandwidth, the video automatically adjusts to a lower quality video. How is this achieved?"]}, {"question": "Why shouldn't we store thumbnail images in database?", "answer": "Beacause the image file is too big. Instead, we can store the image url in the database (or key) so that a further query for the image to Dynamo or S3 can be done.", "hints": []}, {"question": "How would the encoder work?", "answer": "A message queue @link[](mq1) can handle the interactions between the video chunks and the different video formats. Producer will be the chunks of videos and the consumer will be the encoder to encode to specific formats. Another benefit of message queue is that should the connection drop, the chunks are still held in the queue and can be easily resumed during upload.", "hints": ["There would be many chunks of videos coming in and many different formats as output. How should we store the data so that this can be managed easily?"]}]}, "lesson_id": "youtube4", "lesson_title": "Design YouTube High Level Architecture", "video_url": "https://youtu.be/TXD7LgVrDi0", "question": "How can we improve the latency being transmitted by video streaming?", "hint": "There would be many chunks of videos coming in and many different formats as output.
