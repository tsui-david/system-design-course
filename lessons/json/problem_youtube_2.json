{"problem_youtube_2": {"questions": [{"question": "What are some of the capacities, throughput and constraints the system should handle for? i.e. Can you estimate the allocation of resources for our system?", "answer": "Two capacity factors might be: 1. Storage capacity for the number of videos 2. Bandwidth capacity for the bytes streamed In order to estimate the capacity of the video storage, we can work backward.", "hints": ["One criteria might be the storage estimate. How should we figure out how much to store?", "Another criteria could be the bandwidth estimate. How should we figure out the amount of data going through the network? Where might be the bottlenecks?"]}, {"answer": "Each video could be estimated at ~500mb (half a gigabyte) we will then have 100,000 * 500 = 50,000,000mb => 50,000gb => 50TB daily", "question": "What would be daily storage capacity needed for videos?", "hints": ["Remember to use easy to estimate numbers"]}, {"answer": "Since we have 50TB stored daily, that will be 50/24/60 ~> 50/25/60 ~> 2/60 ~> 1/30 ~= 0.03 TB per minute or 30 GB per minute", "question": "How much data would be uploaded a minute to our server", "hints": []}]}, "lesson_id": "youtube2", "lesson_title": "Design YouTube Capacity Estimation", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TltduEuSvc4&feature=youtu.be"}
