Storage capacity for the number of videos 2. Bandwidth capacity for the bytes streamed In order to estimate the capacity of the video storage, we can work backward.", "hints": ["One criteria might be the storage estimate. How should we figure out how much to store?", "Another criteria could be the bandwidth estimate. How should we figure out the amount of data going through the network? Where might be the bottlenecks?"]}, {"question": "How many videos would there be?", "answer": "We need to figure out: 1. How many daily active users (DAU) upload 2. How many videos uploaded? 3. Over what amount of time? If we assume 10 million DAU and 10% are uploaders, we will have **100,000** uploaders. Let's say each uploader uploads 1 video a day, we will have 100,000 videos.", "hints": ["Remember to use easy to estimate numbers"]}, {"question": "What would be daily storage capacity needed for videos?", "answer": "Each video could be estimated at ~500mb (half a gigabyte) we will then have 100,000 * 500 = 50,000,000mb => 50,000gb => 50TB daily", "hints": []}, {"question": "We tackled the storage capacity, let's see how we can estimate the daily bandwidth.
