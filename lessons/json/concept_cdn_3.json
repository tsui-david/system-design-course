{"concept_cdn_3": {"questions": [{"question": "When would you use a CDN?", "answer": "CDNs should really only be used by websites with high traffic and websites that have global reach. This is because CDNs can protect the host server from large surges in traffic which are instead handled by the CDN and because users from other parts of the globe will have a similar experience to users that are closer to the host server with CDNs. Websites that don't experience either of these issues would not reap the benefits provided by CDNs.", "hints": ["Remember the cost of CDNs and how they work (geographically)."]}]}, "lesson_id": "cdn_3", "lesson_title": "CDNs IRL", "video_url": "???", "question": "How would Netflix use a CDN?", "hint": "Remember the cost of CDNs and how they work (geographically)."}
