{"concept_caching_3": {"questions": [{"question": "What are some considerations to take into account when caching?", "answer": "The major considerations to take into account are: - Invalidation: the cache can become outdated and must rely on the source of truth (data store, recomputed values, etc). This is particularly an issue on a larger scale (see CDNs). - Eviction: caches can only hold a portion of the data, therefore once the cache is full, data that is no longer useful must be discarded. - Expiration: data in that cache that has not been accessed for an extended period of time violates the Locality of Reference Principle and most likely means that it should be removed from the cache.", "hints": ["Caches are limited, what happens when they reach their limit?"]}, {"answer": "Because caches can only hold a part of the data, data that is no longer useful must be discarded. These six cache eviction policies provide some examples how: - Least Recently Used (LRU) - Least Frequently Used (LFU) - Most Recently Used (MRU) - First In First Out (FIFO) - Last In First Out (LIFO) - Random Replacement (RR)", "question": "List and explain the most popular cache eviction policies.", "hints": ["Given a cache and database that you must write to, think of the different order you might share data between the two.", "Think of data structures and their methods of removing elements."]}]}, "lesson_id": "caching_3", "lesson_title": "Cache Invalidation and It's Friends", "video_url": "???"}
