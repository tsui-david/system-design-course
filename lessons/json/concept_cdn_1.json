CDNs are designed to reduce latency (the delay between a request and receiving the data) caused by physical distance between the requesting node and the hosting server. Because of distributed and powerful networks, CDNs today serve a majority of web traffic and allow for extremely fast transfer of static media.", "hints": []}]}, "lesson_id": "cdn1", "lesson_title": "Content Delivery Network Introduction", "video_url": "???", "question": "How does content get added to the CDN?"}
