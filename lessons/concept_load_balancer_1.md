@question
What is load balancing? What primary problems does it solve?

@answer
Load balancing is the practice of taking incoming request and distributing them evenly among multiple servers. Load balancing resolves two primary issues:
1. Single point of failure: if a server were to fail or go offline, the service would become unavailable.
2. Overloaded servers: if a server reaches it's operating capacity, it's ability to entertain additional requests ends and users will experience outages.

Load balancing is necessary and must be implemented for any website or service with more than one server and a nontrivial amount of traffic.
